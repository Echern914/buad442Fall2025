# Challenge 01: Data Quality Assessment

## Overview
This challenge focuses on identifying and addressing data quality issues that can lead to poor analytical decisions. Students will learn to recognize common data quality problems and implement systematic approaches to assess and improve data quality.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify common data quality issues (missing values, outliers, inconsistencies)
- Implement systematic data quality assessment procedures
- Use appropriate tools to detect and visualize data quality problems
- Develop strategies for handling data quality issues
- Communicate data quality findings effectively

## Challenge Duration
**1 Hour**

## Tools Required
- **R**: For statistical analysis and visualization
- **Python**: For data manipulation and quality checks
- **Quarto**: For creating professional reports
- **DOT**: For creating data quality assessment flowcharts

## Challenge Tasks
1. **Data Exploration** (15 minutes)
   - Load and examine the provided dataset
   - Identify potential data quality issues
   - Create initial visualizations

2. **Quality Assessment** (25 minutes)
   - Implement systematic quality checks
   - Document findings and issues
   - Create quality assessment dashboard

3. **Issue Resolution** (15 minutes)
   - Propose solutions for identified issues
   - Implement basic data cleaning procedures
   - Document decisions and rationale

4. **Reporting** (5 minutes)
   - Create a brief report summarizing findings
   - Include recommendations for data quality improvement

## Submission Requirements
- Code files (R and/or Python)
- Quarto report with findings
- DOT flowchart of quality assessment process
- Brief reflection on the challenge

## Grading Criteria
- **Data Quality Detection** (30%): Ability to identify relevant quality issues
- **Analysis Quality** (25%): Systematic approach to assessment
- **Documentation** (20%): Clear documentation of process and findings
- **Communication** (15%): Effective presentation of results
- **Reflection** (10%): Thoughtful reflection on learning experience

## Files to Submit
- `submission.md` - Summary of your approach and findings
- `code/` - All code files used in the analysis
- `outputs/` - Generated visualizations and reports
- `report.qmd` - Final Quarto report
- `reflection.md` - Personal reflection on the challenge
