**Student Name:** [Student Name]  
**Date:** [Submission Date]  
**Challenge:** Data Quality Assessment  
**Time Spent:** [Actual time spent]

## Approach Summary

### Data Exploration (15 minutes)
- Loaded the customer_sales.csv dataset using pandas
- Performed initial exploratory data analysis
- Identified potential quality issues: missing values in 'customer_rating' column, outliers in 'sales_amount'

### Quality Assessment (25 minutes)
- Created systematic quality checks for:
  - Missing values analysis
  - Outlier detection using IQR method
  - Data type consistency
  - Range validation for categorical variables
- Generated quality assessment dashboard using R ggplot2

### Issue Resolution (15 minutes)
- Handled missing values using median imputation for numerical data
- Removed extreme outliers (>3 standard deviations)
- Standardized categorical variable formats
- Documented all decisions in code comments

### Reporting (5 minutes)
- Created Quarto report summarizing findings
- Generated DOT flowchart of quality assessment process
- Included recommendations for ongoing data quality monitoring

## Key Findings

1. **Missing Values**: 15% of customer_rating values were missing
2. **Outliers**: 3% of sales_amount values were statistical outliers
3. **Data Types**: All variables had appropriate data types
4. **Consistency**: Minor inconsistencies in product_category naming

## Recommendations

1. Implement automated data quality checks
2. Establish data validation rules for new data entry
3. Create regular quality monitoring reports
4. Train staff on data entry best practices

## Files Submitted

- `code/data_quality_analysis.py` - Main Python analysis script
- `code/quality_checks.R` - R script for statistical analysis
- `outputs/quality_dashboard.html` - Interactive quality dashboard
- `outputs/quality_flowchart.png` - DOT-generated flowchart
- `report.qmd` - Final Quarto report
- `reflection.md` - Personal reflection

## Challenges Faced

- Time constraint made it difficult to implement all quality checks
- Had to prioritize most critical issues
- Learning curve with DOT syntax for flowchart creation

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained appreciation for systematic data quality assessment
- Learned to balance thoroughness with time constraints
- Improved skills in communicating technical findings to stakeholders
